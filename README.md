# Loan_Risk_Analysis-Python
Introduction
Solving this case study will give you an idea of how real-life business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, you will apply the techniques that you have learnt in EDA. You will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data minimises the risk of losing money while lending it to customers.

Business Objectives
This company is the largest online loan marketplace facilitating personal loans, business loans, and the financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
Like most other lending companies, lending to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or absconds with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the biggest losses to lenders. In this case, customers labelled as ‘charged-off’ are the ‘defaulters’.
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced, thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
To develop your understanding of the domain, you are advised to independently research a little about risk analytics (understanding the types of variables and their significance should be enough).
